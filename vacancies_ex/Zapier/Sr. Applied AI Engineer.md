Location: Americas / EMEA for the Data AI/ ML role. Americas for the other two teams.

Hi there!

Zapier is hiring multiple Senior Applied AI Engineers to help us build the future of automation with AI at its core. If you care about shipping real products, solving hard problems with large language models, and creating tools that help others build faster—this is your kind of role.

We’re hiring across multiple teams, each with their own flavor of AI work. You’ll work on things like shared libraries, evaluation systems, orchestration patterns, or user-facing features—depending on the team. What they all have in common: you’ll ship to production, own meaningful problems, and make an impact across the company.

Here’s what each team is working on:

    Data AI/ML: This team builds shared AI infrastructure used across Zapier. They own tools like our LLM proxy, evaluation systems, and the internal ai-toolkit that makes it easier for other teams to build AI features. You'll help improve reliability, speed, and observability across everything we do with LLMs. If you like building foundational systems that power lots of other products, this is your team!

    Model Context Protocol (MCP): MCP is a new standard that helps AI assistants connect to tools and data. We’re building a full-featured implementation at Zapier, and you’ll help define how 8,000+ apps become usable by AI—securely and reliably. It’s early days, so there’s lots to shape: from protocol details to user-facing interactions. If you like open standards, API design, and making AI actually useful, this team’s for you!

    Agents: Zapier Agents is one of our most ambitious bets: an AI assistant that helps users get work done across thousands of apps. You’ll work on memory, reasoning, integrations, and the interface that helps users delegate tasks with natural language. We’re a fast-moving product team that’s still discovering what’s possible, and what’s needed. If you want to build AI that helps real people do real work, you’ll love this team!

    Growth: This team drives Zapier's expansion engine by making AI-powered automation discovery effortless and viral. You'll build and optimize our Copilot experience—the AI assistant that helps users discover, design, and refine complete automation systems through natural language conversations. Your work powers the discovery flow that turns "I need to solve this business problem" into "Here's your full automation solution, ready to deploy." You'll also develop LLM-driven features that help users find the right combination of tools, workflows, and integrations to build comprehensive systems. If you love building AI that removes friction and helps millions of people discover what's possible with end-to-end automation, we would love to have you join us!

Even though our job description may seem like we're looking for a specific candidate, the role inevitably ends up tailored to the person who applies and joins. Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if you meet these criteria:

About You

    You have 7+ years of experience in software engineering, with at least 5 of those years dedicated to building distributed, scalable cloud based web applications. You possess strong communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and a drive to deliver outstanding customer experiences for both external users and internal stakeholders.

    You have at least 1 year of experience working with large language models (LLMs) to perform complex tasks in production environments. You experimented with build user facing leveraging agent architectures.

    You’re familiar with underlying technologies like transformer networks, attention mechanisms, and how they contribute to models’ abilities to generate coherent responses, generate function calls, and perform other language tasks.

    You have likely deployed evaluation frameworks for LLMs, with an understanding on performance, reliability, and bias assessment.

    You likely have experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and understand how to optimize knowledge retrieval for improved model accuracy and speed. You likely have experience with different indexing and chunking strategies based on the system’s data and goals, as well as semantic search and vector databases, and how they differ from traditional retrieval methods and databases.

    You have experience of working through the full lifecycle of building, testing, deploying, and scaling LLM architectures.

    You can identify and document trade-offs made during the development process. You also have experience building with cloud infrastructure technologies.

    You love shipping to customers. You’ll be on a team focused on understanding customers' needs and translating those needs from specifications into functional, production-ready code. You know how to balance speed versus quality to support the features we build for our customers.

    You embody our values. At Zapier, our values are at the heart of how we work together and how we think about our customers. In our remote setting, they help develop trust and ensure we work and collaborate to democratize automation.

Things You’ll Do

    You understand that AI-based applications thrive on data-driven feedback loops, which will be central to any system you develop. These loops will capture and instrument user data, synthesize core use cases, and implement/test strategies with LLMs to enhance performance.

    You will be responsible for integrating LLMs into software products at Zapier, which will include setting up the necessary infrastructure to ensure performance, scalability, and reliability.

    You will work mostly in TypeScript. Experience isn’t strictly required, but it is a big plus. Comfort with typed languages and modern backend practices is a must.

    You will explore new and divergent LLM systems that can create measurable improvements over our current implementations.

    You will design and implement prompting strategies for LLMs to help users create new automations, making the process more intuitive and efficient.

    You will design and develop comprehensive evaluation suites to assess model performance and reliability.

    You will monitor the performance and health of AI systems, proactively detecting and addressing issues such as system failures and performance degradation.

    You will collaborate with Data and cross-functional teams to refine and deploy LLM-based features.

Difference between an Applied AI Engineer and an ML Engineer at Zapier:

How do we discern between other AI-forward engineering roles like ML Engineers and Applied AI Engineers? Both roles benefit from backend engineering skills and experience with LLMs.

    ML engineers are expected to have more experience building data pipelines as well as experience utilizing other types of ML models beyond LLMs.

    AI engineers are expected to have more full stack engineering experience, which would typically include frontend experience, and may only have experience working with LLMs.
