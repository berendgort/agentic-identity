About the role:

ML developers today face significant friction in taking trained models into deployment. They work in a highly fragmented space, with incomplete and patchwork solutions that require significant performance tuning and non-generalizable/ model-specific enhancements. At Modular, we are building the next generation AI platform that will radically improve the way developers build and deploy AI models.

A core part of this offering is providing a platform that allows customers to achieve state-of-the-art performance across use cases, model families, and hardware. As an GenAI Performance Engineer, you will join a small team of generalist engineers that optimize the performance of Modular’s MAX product in both breadth and depth. As part of deep dives on high-value models, you will collaborate with Kernel, Graph Compiler, and Cloud engineers to push Modular’s cutting-edge performance even further. Simultaneously, the performance team builds and applies performance analysis tooling to study and optimize the performance of MAX Engine and MAX Serve over a vast array of user configurations on a wide variety of CPU, GPU and Accelerator hardware.

LOCATION: Candidates based in the US or Canada are welcome to apply. You can work in our office in Los Altos, CA or remotely from home. Onboarding for new hires is conducted in-person in our Los Altos, CA office.
What you will do:

    Measure, analyze, and identify opportunities to improve the performance of the MAX product under realistic and relevant usage patterns
    Partner with the product and customer teams to understand the performance of the MAX product in both standard and cutting edge AI applications and design benchmarks to reflect them
    Collaborate with the kernels and GenAI modeling team to bring up new model families
    Collaborate with the kernels and runtime team to bring up and optimize new GPUs and accelerators
    Collaborate with the cloud team to design and benchmark advanced serving features and new serving algorithms
    Build statistical models and tools to operate on benchmarking & telemetry data and help develop key insights for performance, cloud costs, etc.

What you bring to the table:

    5+ years of professional or postgraduate academic experience working on or researching performance analysis, tooling or benchmarking
    Expertise in performance measurement (i.e. benchmarking), modeling, and analysis on real-world workloads
    Extensive experience with Python
    Creativity and curiosity for solving complex problems
    Experience writing production-quality software
    Strong written and verbal communication skills

 
What Modular brings to the table:
