About Anthropic

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.
About the team

The Tool Use team within Research is responsible for making Claude the world's most capable, reliable, safe, and efficient model for tool use and agentic applications. The team focuses on the foundational layer - solving core problems such as tool call accuracy, long horizon & complex tool use workflow, large scale & dynamic tools, tool hallucination, tool use safety (e.g. prompt injection robustness), and tool use efficiency.  These are foundations to the majority of Anthropic’s customers as well as internal teams building specific agentic capabilities such as coding (including Claude Code), search & deep research, memory, and multi-agents. 

Note: We are currently prioritising growing this team's safety efforts. However, we are leaving this form open as an expression of interest since we expect to be growing the rest of the team in the future, and we will review your application when we do. 
About the role

We're looking for Research Engineers/Scientists to help us advance the frontier of tool use research. Today's AI agents handle impressive workflows. With tool use adoption accelerating rapidly across our platform, the next generation requires even more breakthrough research: for example, enabling models to reliably orchestrate vast tool ecosystems, maintain safety in autonomous operations, and scale to handle the increasing complexity of real-world tasks.

You'll collaborate with a diverse group of researchers and engineers to advance Claude's tool use capabilities and safety. You'll own the full research lifecycle—from identifying fundamental limitations to implementing solutions that ship in production models. We value diverse perspectives and exceptional depth in specific areas—whether that's groundbreaking RL research, exceptional engineering, or novel approaches from other quantitative fields.

Note: For this role, we conduct all interviews in Python.
Responsibilities:

    Define and pursue research agendas that push the boundaries of what's possible
    ​​Design and implement novel reinforcement learning environments and methodologies that push the state of the art of tool use
    Build rigorous, realistic evaluations that capture the complexity of real-world tool use
    Ship research advances that directly impact millions of users
    Collaborate with other frontier research and product teams to drive fundamental breakthroughs in capabilities and safety, and work with teams to ship these into production
    Design, implement, and debug code across our research and production ML stacks
    Contribute to our collaborative research culture through pair programming, technical discussions, and team problem-solving

You may be a good fit if you:

    Are driven by real-world impact and excited to see research ship in production
    Have strong machine learning research/applied-research experience, or a strong quantitative background such as physics, mathematics, or quant research
    Write clean, reliable code and have solid software engineering skills
    Communicate complex ideas clearly to diverse audiences
    Are passionate about building AI systems that are both powerful and safe
    Are hungry to learn and grow, regardless of years of experience

Strong candidates may also have one or more of the following:

    Experience with reinforcement learning techniques and environments
    Experience with language model training, fine-tuning or evaluation
    Experience building AI agents or autonomous systems
    Published influential work in relevant ML areas
    Deep expertise in a specific area (e.g., exceptional RL research, systems engineering, or mathematical foundations) even if still developing in other areas
    Experience shipping features or working closely with product teams
    Enthusiasm for pair programming and collaborative research

The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.

Annual Salary:

$315,000 - $425,000 USD
