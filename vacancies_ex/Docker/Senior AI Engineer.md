About the job

At Docker, we make app development easier so developers can focus on what matters. Our remote-first team spans the globe, united by a passion for innovation and great developer experiences. With over 20 million monthly users and 20 billion image pulls, Docker is the #1 tool for building, sharing, and running apps—trusted by startups and Fortune 100s alike. We’re growing fast and just getting started. Come join us for a whale of a ride!

Join Docker's AI engineering team as a Senior AI Engineer to help shape the future of developer tooling through artificial intelligence. We're building "Ask Gordon," an AI assistant that powers Docker Desktop and CLI, transforming how millions of developers interact with containerization technology. Our AI platform helps developers troubleshoot containers, optimize Dockerfiles, and navigate the Docker ecosystem with intelligent, contextual assistance.

You'll work alongside a team of seasoned engineers to take our successful AI product to the next level, expanding usage and Gordon’s deployment. This is a unique opportunity to apply cutting-edge AI techniques to real-world developer problems at massive scale.

Responsibilities

    Advance AI Capabilities: Enhance Ask Gordon's ability to understand complex technical questions and provide accurate, actionable responses about Docker, containerization, and development workflows
    RAG System Enhancement: Improve our Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline to better understand Docker documentation, code repositories, and technical knowledge sources
    Evaluation & Testing: Design and implement robust evaluation frameworks to measure AI performance, accuracy, and user satisfaction
    Model Development & Fine-tuning: Train, fine-tune, and optimize language models specifically for Docker's technical domain and use cases
    Rapid Prototyping: Iterate quickly on new AI features and capabilities, moving from concept to production efficiently
    Cross-functional Collaboration: Work closely with product managers, designers, and other engineers to integrate AI capabilities seamlessly into Docker's developer experience

Qualifications

    AI/ML Expertise: 3+ years of hands-on experience with machine learning models, particularly large language models (LLMs)
    RAG Systems: Practical experience building and optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems
    Model Training & Fine-tuning: Proven experience training, fine-tuning, or adapting models for specific domains or use cases
    Evaluation Frameworks: Experience designing and implementing AI evaluation methodologies and metrics
    Programming Skills: Proficiency in Go (primary at Docker) and Python
    AI Frameworks: Experience with LangChain/LangGraph or similar AI orchestration frameworks
    Rapid Iteration: Demonstrated ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on user feedback
    Experience with containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes) or developer tooling (preferred)
    Knowledge of vector databases and semantic search technologies (preferred)
    Experience with AI safety, hallucination detection, and reliability techniques (preferred)
