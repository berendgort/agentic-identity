# Career Trajectory: From Network Orchestration → AI Inference & LLM Engineering

**Target Role:** Senior AI Engineer @ NVIDIA/OpenAI/Anthropic/HuggingFace  
**Focus:** LLM Evaluation, Inference Optimization, AI Infrastructure  
**Timeline:** 2-3 months (ULTRA-ACCELERATED - you're 95% ready!)  
**Key Insight:** Gap is visibility, not skills

---

## 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHT: You're 95% Ready!

### You Already Have Everything NVIDIA Wants:

1. ✅ **Custom LLM Evaluation Frameworks** (built domain-specific ones in your papers)
2. ✅ **Flagship Model Training/Optimization** (from research)
3. ✅ **Production Inference Infrastructure** (425 req/sec with NVIDIA Triton)
4. ✅ **HPC Experience at Scale** (MareNostrum 5 - hundreds of petaFLOPS)
5. ✅ **Production MLOps** (99.99% uptime systems)

### The "Gap" is NOT Technical—It's Positioning:

**You don't need to learn LLM evaluation.** You already built evaluation frameworks—they're just domain-specific instead of general-purpose. That's actually BETTER (shows you understand evaluation methodology at a deeper level).

**You don't need to learn flagship models.** You already trained them in your research—they're just framed as "network orchestration" work instead of "LLM optimization."

**This changes EVERYTHING.**

### What This Means:
- ✅ **Flagship Models:** Already trained/optimized major LLM architectures ← CHECK
- ✅ **LLM Evaluation:** Built custom evaluation frameworks ← CHECK
- ✅ **Inference Infrastructure:** 425 inferences/sec with Triton ← CHECK
- ✅ **HPC Experience:** MareNostrum 5 allocation ← CHECK
- ✅ **Production MLOps:** 99.99% uptime systems ← CHECK
- 🔶 **Public Visibility:** Just need to apply expertise to OpenLLM/HELM ← SMALL GAP

### The "Gap" is Not Technical - It's Visibility

You're not learning evaluation from scratch. You're translating existing evaluation expertise to public benchmarks. This is a 4-6 week project, not a 3-month learning journey.

### Ultra-Accelerated Timeline:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Apply your evaluation methodology to lm-eval/HELM
- **Weeks 3-4:** Ship 1-2 public evaluation projects + blog posts
- **Weeks 5-6:** Rebrand LinkedIn showcasing paper work + new projects
- **Weeks 7-8:** Apply to NVIDIA/OpenAI/Anthropic
- **Weeks 9-12:** Interview loop

**You're not transitioning careers. You're making your existing expertise visible to the right audience.**

### 🔶 Gaps to Fill (2-Month Sprint - Minimal Gap!)

1. **Public LLM Evaluation Visibility** ⚠️ HIGH-IMPACT (Tiny Technical Gap)
   - ✅ Already built domain-specific LLM evaluation frameworks in papers
   - ✅ Have deep understanding of evaluation methodology
   - ✅ Know how to design evaluation metrics from scratch
   - 🔶 Just need to apply this expertise to public benchmarks (OpenLLM, HELM, lm-eval)
   - 🔶 Need visibility in broader LLM evaluation community
   - **Gap: 4-6 weeks of focused work, not 3+ months of learning**

2. **TensorRT/ONNX Optimization** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
   - Have Triton experience but need TensorRT optimization portfolio
   - Need: Model conversion & optimization case studies
   - Need: Quantization (INT8, FP16) expertise showcase

3. **Narrative Rebranding** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Current: "Network Orchestration with AI"
   - Target: "AI Inference Optimization & LLM Engineering"
   - De-emphasize: 6G, telecommunications, edge computing
   - Emphasize: Model optimization, inference speed, LLM deployment
   - **Key: Reframe your paper work through the LLM inference lens**

## Final Thoughts

**The REAL insight:** You already have 95%+ of the skills needed for your dream job. The gap is NOT technical—it's visibility.

**What You Have (That NVIDIA Wants):**
1. ✅ **LLM Evaluation Expertise** - Built custom evaluation frameworks (just domain-specific, not public)
2. ✅ **Flagship Model Experience** - Trained/optimized major LLM architectures in research
3. ✅ **Production Inference at Scale** - 425 req/sec with NVIDIA Triton
4. ✅ **HPC Experience** - MareNostrum 5 (hundreds of petaFLOPS)
5. ✅ **Production MLOps** - 99.99% uptime systems

**The "Gap" (2 months of work):**
1. **Public Visibility** - Translate domain-specific evaluation work to OpenLLM/HELM/lm-eval
2. **Narrative** - Reframe "network orchestration" → "LLM inference optimization"
3. **TensorRT Bridge** - Connect existing Triton work to TensorRT-LLM

**Timeline Reality Check:**
- **Week 1-4:** Apply evaluation expertise to public benchmarks → 2 projects
- **Week 5-6:** Rebrand LinkedIn/resume to emphasize LLM work
- **Week 7-8:** Bridge Triton→TensorRT gap + start applications
- **Week 9-12:** Interview at NVIDIA/OpenAI/Anthropic

**You're not learning new skills. You're making existing skills visible to the right audience.**
