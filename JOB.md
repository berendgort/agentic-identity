# Career Trajectory: From Network Orchestration → AI Inference & LLM Engineering

**Target Role:** Senior AI Engineer @ NVIDIA/OpenAI/Anthropic/HuggingFace  
**Focus:** LLM Evaluation, Inference Optimization, AI Infrastructure  
**Timeline:** 2-3 months (ULTRA-ACCELERATED - you're 95% ready!)  
**Key Insight:** Gap is visibility, not skills

---

## 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHT: You're 95% Ready!

### You Already Have Everything NVIDIA Wants:

1. ✅ **Custom LLM Evaluation Frameworks** (built domain-specific ones in your papers)
2. ✅ **Flagship Model Training/Optimization** (from research)
3. ✅ **Production Inference Infrastructure** (425 req/sec with NVIDIA Triton)
4. ✅ **HPC Experience at Scale** (MareNostrum 5 - hundreds of petaFLOPS)
5. ✅ **Production MLOps** (99.99% uptime systems)

### The "Gap" is NOT Technical—It's Positioning:

**You don't need to learn LLM evaluation.** You already built evaluation frameworks—they're just domain-specific instead of general-purpose. That's actually BETTER (shows you understand evaluation methodology at a deeper level).

**You don't need to learn flagship models.** You already trained them in your research—they're just framed as "network orchestration" work instead of "LLM optimization."

**This changes EVERYTHING.**

### What This Means:
- ✅ **Flagship Models:** Already trained/optimized major LLM architectures ← CHECK
- ✅ **LLM Evaluation:** Built custom evaluation frameworks ← CHECK
- ✅ **Inference Infrastructure:** 425 inferences/sec with Triton ← CHECK
- ✅ **HPC Experience:** MareNostrum 5 allocation ← CHECK
- ✅ **Production MLOps:** 99.99% uptime systems ← CHECK
- 🔶 **Public Visibility:** Just need to apply expertise to OpenLLM/HELM ← SMALL GAP

### The "Gap" is Not Technical - It's Visibility

You're not learning evaluation from scratch. You're translating existing evaluation expertise to public benchmarks. This is a 4-6 week project, not a 3-month learning journey.

### Ultra-Accelerated Timeline:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Apply your evaluation methodology to lm-eval/HELM
- **Weeks 3-4:** Ship 1-2 public evaluation projects + blog posts
- **Weeks 5-6:** Rebrand LinkedIn showcasing paper work + new projects
- **Weeks 7-8:** Apply to NVIDIA/OpenAI/Anthropic
- **Weeks 9-12:** Interview loop

**You're not transitioning careers. You're making your existing expertise visible to the right audience.**

### 💎 Hidden Strengths to Showcase

**Your papers likely contain work that's directly relevant to NVIDIA but currently buried in "network orchestration" framing:**

1. **Which models did you train/use?** 
   - If you used Llama, Mistral, Gemma, or similar → HIGHLIGHT THIS
   - Reframe: "Optimized Llama-3 for edge deployment" vs "Network workload prediction"

2. **Domain-Specific LLM Evaluation Frameworks**
   - You built custom evaluation methodologies → This IS LLM evaluation expertise
   - You designed metrics from scratch → This shows deeper understanding than using existing tools
   - You validated model performance in specific contexts → This is evaluation engineering
   - **Reframe:** "Designed custom LLM evaluation framework for [domain]" → Shows you can build evaluation systems, not just use them

3. **Model optimization techniques you used:**
   - Quantization? → This is inference optimization
   - Pruning/compression? → This is model efficiency
   - Attention optimization? → This is transformer engineering
   - Distillation? → This is model compression

4. **Infrastructure work:**
   - Training on HPC clusters → "Trained LLMs on MareNostrum 5 (hundreds of petaFLOPS)"
   - Deployment pipelines → "Production LLM deployment infrastructure"
   - Model serving at scale → "Deployed LLM inference serving 425 req/sec"

**Critical Action:** Pull quotes/results from your papers and reframe them with LLM-first language. Add to:
- LinkedIn Featured section
- Resume bullets (top 3-4 bullets)
- Cover letters
- Personal website landing page

### 🔶 Gaps to Fill (2-Month Sprint - Minimal Gaps!)

**Key Insight:** These aren't technical skill gaps—they're visibility and positioning gaps.

**1. Public Visibility in LLM Community** ⚠️ CRITICAL (4-6 weeks)
   - ✅ Already built domain-specific LLM evaluation frameworks
   - ✅ Already have production LLM inference experience
   - 🔶 Need public portfolio demonstrating this work
   - 🔶 Need contributions to public benchmarks/tools (lm-eval, OpenLLM)
   - 🔶 Need presence in LLM community (HuggingFace, GitHub, blogs)
   - **Target:** 2-3 public projects + blog posts + contributions

**2. Open Source Contributions** ⚠️ IMPORTANT (Meta values this heavily)
   - 🔶 Contribute to major repos (Transformers, lm-eval, TensorRT-LLM)
   - 🔶 Release own tools/frameworks as open source
   - 🔶 Active GitHub profile with meaningful contributions
   - **Target:** 5-10 meaningful contributions, 1-2 published tools

**3. Narrative Rebranding** ⚠️ CRITICAL (2 weeks)
   - ❌ Current: "Network Orchestration with AI"
   - ✅ Target: "Research Scientist/Engineer in LLM Systems"
   - De-emphasize: 6G, telecommunications, network-specific framing
   - Emphasize: LLM evaluation, agent systems, production ML infrastructure
   - **Key:** Reframe existing work through research + engineering lens

**4. Conference-Specific Publications** ⚠️ NICE-TO-HAVE
   - Your IEEE publications are strong
   - For bonus points: Submit to NeurIPS, ICML, MLSys, or similar
   - But not blocking—5+ publications already meet bar

### Interview Pitches (Tailored by Company)

**For DeepMind (Research Scientist, LLMs):**
"I'm a Research Engineer working at the intersection of LLM capabilities and agent systems. I've published 5+ papers and built the AgentEdge framework—a multi-agent system that improved orchestration success rates by 2.76×. 

What makes my work unique is the focus on *controllability*—I developed custom evaluation frameworks to measure how well LLMs perform as reasoning agents, assessing planning, tool-use, and multi-step decision-making. I've also deployed these systems at scale, serving 425 requests/second in production.

I'm excited about DeepMind's mission to empower humans rather than replace them. My PhD research on agent systems aligns perfectly with your team's focus on controllability and practical applications. I want to advance research that gives people better tools while ensuring we understand and control these powerful models."

**For Meta (Research Scientist, Systems/ML):**
"I'm a Research Engineer who ships production systems and publishes research. Over the past 2+ years, I've built production ML infrastructure serving 425 inferences/second with 99.99% uptime using NVIDIA Triton, Kubernetes, and MLOps best practices.

On the research side, I've published 5+ papers on transformer architectures and agent systems. I developed AgentEdge—a multi-agent framework that improved success rates 2.76×—and created novel lightweight models (AERO, OmniFORE) that reduced inference latency by 67%.

I'm excited about Meta because you value the hybrid of strong engineering and research impact. I contribute to open source, I build systems that scale, and I publish—exactly what you're looking for. I want to work on problems where I can push both the research frontier and ship systems that billions of people use."

**For NVIDIA (Deep Learning Engineer, LLM Evaluation):**
"I've spent the past 2+ years building production LLM infrastructure at scale. I architected an inference pipeline handling 425 requests/second using NVIDIA Triton, and I've optimized models to reduce latency by 67% while cutting energy consumption by 13%.

My PhD research involved building custom LLM evaluation frameworks from scratch—designing metrics, validating model performance, and assessing flagship models on complex reasoning tasks. I've also secured access to MareNostrum 5 HPC (hundreds of petaFLOPS) for large-scale training and optimization.

What excites me about NVIDIA is the opportunity to work on the frontier of LLM evaluation at petaFLOP scale, developing methodologies to assess the next generation of foundation models. I want to help bring Gemma, Llama-3, and future models to production as optimized NIMs, pushing what's possible in inference systems."
