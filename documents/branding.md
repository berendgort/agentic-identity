## 🚀 Platform Strategy

### 1. LinkedIn (PRIMARY - 50% effort)

**Why:** Direct line to recruiters and hiring managers at target companies.

**Profile Optimization (Subtle Updates):**

⚠️ **STEALTH MODE:** Make changes gradually, not all at once!

- [ ] Update headline (GRADUAL): Keep current company, add expertise
  - Current: "Agent + ML Engineer at Nearby Computing"
  - Updated: "Agent + ML Engineer | LLM Systems & Evaluation | PhD Candidate"
  - ❌ DON'T remove company name or add "Open to opportunities"
  
- [ ] Add skills (SAFE): Add new skills without removing old ones
  - Add: "LLM Evaluation", "Agent Systems", "Production ML Infrastructure"
  - Keep: Existing skills from current role
  
- [ ] Add Featured section (GRADUAL):
  - Papers (always safe to showcase)
  - Side projects (GitHub repos - frame as hobby/research)
  - Blog posts (frame as knowledge sharing)
  
- [ ] Update experience bullets (CAREFUL):
  - ✅ Reframe existing work with LLM terminology
  - ❌ DON'T change job title or dates
  - ✅ Credit your current company for achievements
  
- [ ] Summary update (OPTIONAL):
  - ✅ Add a sentence about expanding into LLM evaluation
  - ❌ DON'T remove mention of current role/company
  - Frame as "expanding expertise" not "transitioning"

**Content Strategy (2-3 posts/week):**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Frame everything as "professional development" and "expanding expertise" - NOT job hunting!

**Week 1-2:** Establish credibility (general expertise)
- Post 1: "Exploring the intersection of production ML and LLM evaluation" (technical interest)
- Post 2: Share first blog post (evaluation project - frame as side project/research)
- Post 3: Lessons from building production inference (425 req/sec) - credit your company

**Week 3-4:** Show expertise (educational content)
- Post 4: "3 things I learned building custom LLM evaluation frameworks"
- Post 5: Share agent reasoning evaluation tool launch (side project)
- Post 6: Technical insight from papers (pure technical content)

**Week 5-6:** Build community (helpful content)
- Post 7: "What I wish I knew about LLM inference optimization"
- Post 8: Behind-the-scenes of HPC work (keep generic, or credit work)
- Post 9: Ask community question (spark discussion)

**Week 7-8:** Show momentum (LOW KEY)
- Post 10: "Working on LLM evaluation projects in my spare time - here's what I learned"
- Post 11: ❌ DON'T announce applications! Instead: "Excited about the future of agent systems"
- Post 12: Technical deep dive or paper summary

**⚠️ AVOID:**
- ❌ "Looking for opportunities"
- ❌ "Open to new roles"
- ❌ "Interviewing at..."
- ❌ "Last day at..."
- ❌ Criticizing current work/company
- ❌ "Pivoting my career"

**✅ SAFE FRAMING:**
- ✅ "Expanding my expertise in..."
- ✅ "Side project exploring..."
- ✅ "Learning about..."
- ✅ "Interesting work on..."
- ✅ "Research interests in..."

**Post Format:**
- Lead with hook (first 2 lines matter)
- Keep it concise (200-300 words max)
- Add relevant hashtags: #LLM #MachineLearning #AI #AgenticAI #MLOps
- Always include call-to-action (comment, share, check link)
- Tag relevant people/companies (when appropriate)

**Engagement (Daily 15 minutes - Keep it Natural):**
- [ ] Comment on interesting technical posts (from anyone, not just target companies)
- [ ] Engage with AI/ML researchers/engineers (genuine interest, not networking)
- [ ] Answer questions in your domain (build reputation as helpful expert)
- [ ] Share interesting research/tools (add your perspective)

⚠️ **AVOID:** Obviously networking with specific companies - keep it organic!

## 🕵️ Stealth Job Search Strategy

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** You're still employed - everything must look like professional development, not job hunting!

### What's Safe:
- ✅ Posting technical content about your expertise
- ✅ Side projects framed as research/hobby
- ✅ Contributing to open source (always professional)
- ✅ Writing blog posts (knowledge sharing)
- ✅ Adding skills to LinkedIn gradually
- ✅ Engaging with technical community
- ✅ Showcasing papers and research

### What's Risky:
- ⚠️ Connecting with LOTS of people at one company suddenly
- ⚠️ Changing LinkedIn headline dramatically overnight
- ⚠️ Posting about "new opportunities" or "exciting changes"
- ⚠️ Asking publicly about jobs at specific companies
- ⚠️ Updating "Open to Work" status
- ⚠️ Engaging ONLY with target companies

### When to Apply (Timing Strategy):

**Before Applying (Weeks 1-6):**
- Build technical visibility (projects, blog posts, contributions)
- Gradual LinkedIn updates (add skills, featured section)
- Natural engagement with community
- No obvious signals of job hunting

**Week 7-8: Start Applications (Discreetly):**
- Apply directly on company websites (not LinkedIn "Easy Apply")
- Reach out to recruiters via email/LinkedIn DM (private)
- Get warm intros through private messages
- Don't announce applications publicly

**After You Have Offer(s):**
- Give proper notice to current employer
- THEN update LinkedIn, announce publicly
- Thank current company graciously

---

## 🤝 Subtle Company Engagement

**Goal:** Be on their radar without being obvious.

### DeepMind

- 2 posts/week sustained > posting daily then burning out

**Authenticity > Performance**
- Share what you actually know
- Be honest about challenges
- Help others genuinely
- Build real relationships

**Stealth > Obvious**
- Frame as professional development, not job hunting
- Gradual LinkedIn updates, not overnight changes
- Private applications, not public announcements
- Credit current company, don't burn bridges

**Your goal isn't to become an influencer.**  
**Your goal is to be visible to the right 50 people WITHOUT alerting your current employer.**

🕵️ **Build your presence quietly, apply privately, announce publicly only after you have an offer.**
