Berend Gort
PhD (Cand.) in Agentic AI for Network Orchestration | Agent + ML
Engineer
Barcelona, Catalonië, Spanje
Samenvatting
I'm a Ph.D. Candidate and Agent Engineer dedicated to transforming
telecommunications with intelligent, autonomous systems for the era
of 6G.
Imagine networks powered by coordinated AI agents that think, plan,
and act independently. I design multi-agent systems that use digital
twins to simulate decisions before execution, creating self-managing
networks that adapt in real-time while dramatically reducing energy
consumption.
⚡ My autonomous agents predict, prevent, and optimize
continuously, turning reactive networks into proactive ecosystems
that anticipate demand and heal themselves.
Let's connect and explore the future of agentic AI!
