## About

I'm a PhD Candidate and ML Engineer working on agent systems and LLM evaluation.

I build production ML infrastructure that scales and publish research on how to make AI agents more reliable. My work combines evaluation frameworks that measure agent capabilities with systems that deploy these models in production.

**Recent highlights:**
- AgentEdge framework: 2.76× improvement in multi-agent orchestration
- Production inference with NVIDIA Triton, Kubernetes, and MLOps
- Custom evaluation frameworks for LLM tool use and reasoning
- Model optimization: 67% latency reduction, 13% energy savings
- 5+ publications on transformers and agent systems

Currently finishing my PhD in AI at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya while exploring safer agent systems through evaluation and testing.

I contribute to open source and write about what I learn. Let's connect if you're working on similar problems.

## Publications

### 1. Optimization of Distinct Time-Series Neural Architectures for Cloud-Edge Workload Prediction
**IEEE Machine Learning for Communication and Networking** · Sep 3, 2025

Optimizing resource utilization in cloud-edge networks requires accurate workload prediction under strict computational constraints. Traditional methods like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency in these dynamic environments. In this paper, we evaluate distinct state-of-the-art time-series architectures for containerized workload prediction, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and sparse Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Through empirical analysis using Bayesian optimization, we identify optimal model configurations for cloud-edge workload prediction. Notably, the MLP model achieves comparable memory prediction accuracy to the best CNN model, while using approximately 7,000× less parameters (i.e., 35 vs. 247,091) and 5× faster inference (1.84µs vs. 7.15µs). Our findings provide concrete guidance for model selection across different cloud-edge deployment scenarios, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-capacity cloud servers.

### 2. Attention-Driven AI Model Generalization for Workload Forecasting in the Compute Continuum
**IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking** · Jun 27, 2025

Effective resource management in edge-cloud networks demands precise forecasting of diverse workload resource usage. Due to the fluctuating nature of user demands, prediction models must have strong generalization abilities, ensuring high performance amidst sudden traffic changes or unfamiliar patterns. Existing approaches often struggle with handling long-term dependencies and the diversity of temporal patterns. This paper introduces OmniFORE (Framework for Optimization of Resource forecasts in Edge-cloud networks), which integrates attention-based time-series models with temporal clustering to enhance generalization and predict diverse workloads efficiently in volatile settings. By training on carefully selected subsets from extensive datasets, OmniFORE captures both short-term stability and long-term shifts in resource usage patterns. Experiments show that OmniFORE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, inference speed, and generalization to unseen data, particularly in scenarios with dynamic workload changes and varying trace variance. These improvements enable more efficient resource management in the compute continuum.

### 3. AERO: Adaptive Edge-Cloud Orchestration With a Sub-1K-Parameter Forecasting Model
**IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking** · Mar 1, 2025

Effective resource management in edge-cloud networks is crucial for meeting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements while minimizing operational costs. However, dynamic and fluctuating workloads pose significant challenges for accurate workload prediction and efficient resource allocation, particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. In this paper, we introduce AERO (Adaptive Edge-cloud Resource Orchestration), a novel lightweight forecasting model designed to address these challenges. AERO features an adaptive period detection mechanism that dynamically identifies dominant periodicities in multivariate workload data, allowing it to adjust to varying patterns and abrupt changes. With fewer than 1,000 parameters, AERO is highly suitable for deployment on edge devices with limited computational capacity. We formalize our approach through a comprehensive system model and extend an existing simulation framework with predictor modules to evaluate AERO's performance in realistic cloud-edge environments. Our extensive evaluations on real-world cloud workload datasets demonstrate that AERO achieves comparable prediction accuracy to complex state-of-the-art models with millions of parameters, while significantly reducing model size and computational overhead. In addition, simulations show that AERO improves orchestration performance, reducing energy consumption and response times compared to existing proactive and reactive approaches. Our live deployment experiments further validate these findings, demonstrating that AERO consistently delivers superior performance. These results highlight AERO as an effective solution for improving resource management and reducing operational costs in dynamic cloud-edge environments.

### 4. Forecasting Trends in Cloud-Edge Computing: Unleashing the Power of Attention Mechanisms
**IEEE Communications Magazine** · Oct 22, 2024

In the face of expanding digital landscapes, cloud-edge computing infrastructures struggle with an ever-increasing demand for real-time data management. This demand has a direct impact on the energy consumption of cloud-edge networks, which has spiked dramatically, stressing the need for accurate time-series forecasting. As conventional machine learning models encounter difficulties in predicting volatile workloads, attention mechanisms have emerged thanks to their capability of capturing long-range dependencies. This article pioneers the exploration of attention mechanisms for time-series forecasting in cloud-edge environments, particularly focusing on a promising low-complexity attention mechanism (i.e., informer model). Through comprehensive discussions and experimental validations, we demonstrate that informers significantly outperform traditional models in the prediction accuracy of compute workload forecasting. The outcome of this work not only highlights the importance of attention mechanisms in cloud-edge scenarios, but also paves the way for future optimizations, ultimately aiming at reducing the environmental impact of digital growth.

### 5. Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cryptocurrency Trading: Practical Approach to Address Backtest Overfitting
**Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)** · Dec 16, 2022

Designing profitable and reliable trading strategies is challenging in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. Existing works applied deep reinforcement learning methods and optimistically reported increased profits in backtesting, which may suffer from the false positive issue due to overfitting. In this paper, we propose a practical approach to address backtest overfitting for cryptocurrency trading using deep reinforcement learning. We train different agents, estimate the probability of overfitting, and reject the overfitted agents. We show that the less overfitted agents have higher returns than of more overfitted agents, offering confidence in possible deployment to a real market.
