# LinkedIn Connection Message Templates

Quick templates for connecting with different people at target companies (200 char limit).

---

## 🎯 General Principles

- **Keep it under 200 characters** (LinkedIn limit)
- **Be specific** about shared interests/work
- **No obvious job hunting** ("not applying now" or skip entirely)
- **Show credibility** quickly (PhD, Triton, evaluation, etc.)
- **Natural tone** like you're actually typing, not using a template

## 🚫 What NOT to Say

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "I'm looking for opportunities"
- ❌ "I'm interested in joining [Company]"
- ❌ "Open to work"
- ❌ "Would love to discuss opportunities"
- ❌ "I'd be a great fit for your team"
- ❌ Anything that sounds desperate or templated
- ❌ Long paragraphs of your accomplishments

**Instead:**
- ✅ "Would be good/great to connect"
- ✅ "Would love to connect"
- ✅ "Always good to connect with folks working on [X]"
- ✅ Keep it casual and natural
- ✅ Show genuine interest in their work

---

## 📝 Fill-in-the-Blank Template

When stuck, use this:

```
Hi [Name],

[Something specific about their work/role]. I [your relevant credential/work].

Would [be good to / love to] connect!

Berend
```

**Character count rule:** 150-180 chars is the sweet spot.

## ⚡ Quick Tips

1. **Research first** - Check their profile for 30 seconds
2. **Find common ground** - Shared tech, interests, or goals
3. **Be specific** - "LLM evaluation" not "AI stuff"
4. **Stay casual** - Like texting a colleague, not writing a cover letter
5. **No pressure** - Just connecting, no ask
6. **Respond quickly** - If they accept, say thanks within 24h

---

## 💬 After They Accept (Follow-up Template)

**Keep it light:**
```
Thanks for connecting! Really interested in [their work area]. 

Happy to chat anytime if you'd like to discuss [shared interest]. 

Cheers!
```

**Or just:**
```
Thanks for connecting! 👍
```

**Don't:** Launch into a job pitch immediately after they accept.

## 📅 Connection Strategy

### Weekly Target
- 5-10 new connections at target companies
- Mix of roles: 50% engineers, 30% recruiters, 20% researchers
- Spread across companies (not all at one company at once)

### Natural Cadence
- Monday: 2-3 connections
- Wednesday: 2-3 connections  
- Friday: 1-2 connections
- Don't connect with 20 people at once (looks desperate)

---

## 🎯 Remember

**You're not job hunting, you're:**
- Building your professional network
- Connecting with people in your field
- Expanding your research community
- Learning from others working on similar problems

**The goal:** Be on their radar when the time comes to apply, without looking like you're job hunting.

🕵️ **Stealth mode: Connect like a researcher, not a job seeker.**
