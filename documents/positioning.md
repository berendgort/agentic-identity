## 🎤 Interview Pitches (Company-Specific)

### For Anthropic (Research Engineer, Tool Use) ⭐ TOP FIT
```
I'm a Research Engineer specializing in agent systems and LLM evaluation. I built AgentEdge—a multi-agent framework that improved orchestration success rates by 2.76×—and developed custom evaluation frameworks to assess LLM capabilities in tool use, planning, and multi-step reasoning.

What excites me about Anthropic's Tool Use team is the focus on agent safety and controllability. I've been thinking deeply about how to evaluate and ensure reliable agent behavior—exactly what you need as Claude scales to handle increasingly complex workflows. My production experience (425 req/sec, 99.99% uptime) means I understand the practical constraints of shipping agent systems at scale.

I'm particularly interested in developing rigorous evaluation frameworks for agent capabilities and contributing to the safety research that makes these systems trustworthy.
```

### For DeepMind (Research Scientist, LLMs)
```
I'm a Research Engineer working at the intersection of LLM capabilities and agent systems. I've published 5+ papers and built the AgentEdge framework—a multi-agent system that improved orchestration success rates by 2.76×. 

What makes my work unique is the focus on *controllability*—I developed custom evaluation frameworks to measure how well LLMs perform as reasoning agents, assessing planning, tool-use, and multi-step decision-making. I've also deployed these systems at scale, serving 425 requests/second in production.

I'm excited about DeepMind's mission to empower humans rather than replace them. My PhD research on agent systems aligns perfectly with your team's focus on controllability and practical applications.
```

### For Meta (Research Scientist, Systems/ML)
```
I'm a Research Engineer who ships production systems and publishes research. Over the past 2+ years, I've built production ML infrastructure serving 425 inferences/second with 99.99% uptime using NVIDIA Triton, Kubernetes, and MLOps best practices.

On the research side, I've published 5+ papers on transformer architectures and agent systems. I developed AgentEdge—a multi-agent framework that improved success rates 2.76×—and created novel lightweight models (AERO, OmniFORE) that reduced inference latency by 67%.

I'm excited about Meta because you value the hybrid of strong engineering and research impact. I contribute to open source, I build systems that scale, and I publish—exactly what you're looking for. I want to work on problems where I can push both the research frontier and ship systems that billions of people use.
```

### For NVIDIA (Deep Learning Engineer, LLM Evaluation)
```
I've spent the past 2+ years building production LLM infrastructure at scale. I architected an inference pipeline handling 425 requests/second using NVIDIA Triton, and I've optimized models to reduce latency by 67% while cutting energy consumption by 13%.

My PhD research involved building custom LLM evaluation frameworks from scratch—designing metrics, validating model performance, and assessing flagship models on complex reasoning tasks. I've also secured access to MareNostrum 5 HPC (hundreds of petaFLOPS) for large-scale training and optimization.

What excites me about NVIDIA is the opportunity to work on the frontier of LLM evaluation at petaFLOP scale, developing methodologies to assess the next generation of foundation models. I want to help bring Gemma, Llama-3, and future models to production as optimized NIMs.
```

### For Groq (Senior ML Engineer, Post Training)
```
I'm a Research Engineer with production ML experience optimizing models for fast inference. I've reduced model latency by 67% through compression techniques and deployed systems serving 425 requests/second with 99.99% uptime.

My work includes training and optimizing flagship models (Llama, Gemma, Mistral) and building production inference pipelines. I have hands-on experience with quantization, model compression, and performance optimization—exactly what Groq needs for fast LPU-based inference.

I'm excited about pushing the boundaries of inference speed and making high-performance AI compute more accessible.
