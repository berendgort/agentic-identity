3. **Engage in controversies** - Stay professional, technical
4. **Copy others' content** - Create original insights
5. **Ghost your audience** - Respond to comments, engage back
6. **Burnout on posting** - Quality > frequency, sustainability > speed
7. **Forget your goal** - Every post should move you toward job opportunities

### Do:
1. **Be consistent** - Regular posting builds momentum
2. **Add unique value** - Share your specific expertise
3. **Engage authentically** - Real connections > follower count
4. **Show your work** - Behind-the-scenes, process, learnings
5. **Help others** - Answer questions, share resources
