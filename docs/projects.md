## 📝 Blog Post Guidelines

**Structure:**
1. **Problem/Motivation** (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Methodology** (detailed, reproducible)
3. **Results** (tables, graphs, analysis)
4. **Discussion** (insights, limitations)
5. **Conclusion** (takeaways)
6. **Code/Resources** (GitHub links)

**Style:**
- Technical but accessible
- Show your expertise
- Be honest about limitations
- Include code snippets
- Visualizations > walls of text

**Length:** 1000-2000 words

**Where to publish:**
- Personal website (best)
- Medium (good reach)
- Dev.to (ML community)
- Substack (if building following)

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't:** Build 10 half-finished projects
   **Do:** Build 2-3 complete, polished projects

2. **Don't:** Implement without documenting
   **Do:** Document everything (README, blog, code comments)

3. **Don't:** Ignore community feedback
   **Do:** Engage, iterate, improve

4. **Don't:** Make it too niche
   **Do:** Make it useful to broader community

5. **Don't:** Forget to promote
   **Do:** Share on LinkedIn, HuggingFace, Reddit

---

## 🎉 Remember

**Quality > Quantity**

2-3 well-executed projects > 10 half-finished experiments

Each project should tell a story:
- "I understand LLM evaluation deeply"
- "I can build production systems"
- "I contribute to open source"
- "I communicate technical concepts well"
