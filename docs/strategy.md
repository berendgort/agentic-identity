## 🚀 8-Week Action Plan

### Month 1: Build Public LLM Portfolio

#### Week 1-2: LLM Evaluation Project
- [ ] Set up lm-evaluation-harness (30 min)
- [ ] Review OpenLLM Leaderboard + HELM methodology (1 day)
- [ ] **Project 1:** Port domain-specific evaluation to lm-eval
  - Evaluate Llama-3 vs Gemma on reasoning tasks
  - Compare with public benchmarks
  - Blog post: "From Domain-Specific to General LLM Evaluation"
  - Submit to lm-evaluation-harness as contribution

**Appeals to:** NVIDIA (evaluation), Meta (applied ML), DeepMind (LLM understanding)

#### Week 3-4: Agent Reasoning Evaluation Framework
- [ ] **Project 2:** "Evaluating LLMs for Agentic Capabilities"
  - Build evaluation suite: planning, tool-use, multi-step reasoning
  - Test on Llama-3, Gemma, Mistral
  - Release as open-source tool on GitHub
  - Blog post: "Beyond Accuracy: Evaluating LLMs as Agents"

**Appeals to:** DeepMind (empowering humans), Meta (novel ML), NVIDIA (new eval methods)

**Deliverables:**
- 2 blog posts
- 1 open-source evaluation tool
- 3-5 contributions to lm-eval
- Active GitHub profile

---

### Month 2: Rebranding + Targeted Positioning

#### Week 5-6: Complete Narrative Rebranding

**LinkedIn Overhaul:**
- [ ] Update headline: "Research Engineer | LLM Systems & Agent Evaluation | PhD Candidate"
- [ ] Rewrite summary (de-emphasize network orchestration)
- [ ] Add Featured section (papers, tools, blog posts)
- [ ] Reframe experience bullets (research + engineering focus)

**Tailored Resumes (3 versions):**
- [ ] DeepMind: Emphasize agent systems, interpretability
- [ ] Meta: Emphasize production systems, open source
- [ ] NVIDIA: Emphasize evaluation, inference optimization, HPC

**Personal Website/Portfolio:**
- [ ] Landing page: "Research Engineer in LLM Systems"
- [ ] Projects page with code + results
- [ ] Link to GitHub

#### Week 7-8: Targeted Projects + Applications

**Project 3 (Choose based on priority):**
- **Option A (Meta):** Production LLM inference optimization
- **Option B (NVIDIA):** TensorRT-LLM integration study
- **Option C (DeepMind):** LLM-powered agent controllability framework

**Start Applications:**
- [ ] Apply to 5-7 companies with tailored materials
- [ ] Get warm intros through LinkedIn (10-15 people)
- [ ] Engage with companies' open source projects

**Deliverables:**
- Rebranded LinkedIn + 3 resumes
- Personal website
- 1 additional project
- 5-7 applications

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't mention network orchestration in applications** - Focus on LLM systems
2. **Don't apply before portfolio is ready** - Build 2-3 projects first
3. **Don't neglect open source** - Visibility = contributions
4. **Don't over-emphasize PhD** - It's a checkbox, not the story
5. **Don't wait for perfection** - Ship fast, iterate

---

## 💡 Key Insight

**You're not learning new skills. You're making existing skills visible.**

You're a Research Engineer who's been working in a niche domain (network orchestration). Now you're repositioning that work for a broader LLM audience.

**Same skills. Different framing.**

---

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**YOU'RE 95% READY.**

- ✅ Research + Engineering hybrid profile (rare and valuable)
- ✅ LLM evaluation expertise (domain-specific)
- ✅ Production systems at scale (425 req/sec)
- ✅ Publications + PhD
- 🔶 Just need public visibility (8 weeks)

**The hardest part is resisting impostor syndrome.**
